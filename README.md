# python-practice
Random individual python scripts for practice 

This is just a folder for all the random python tasks I thought of of found beginner/moderate 
skill level prompts for. These are mostly just for getting reacquainted with python after a few 
years of not using it. They're also just for fun because I'd forgotten how much I love coding until 
recently.
